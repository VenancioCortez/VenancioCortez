<p><b>"What’s it like to miss you”</b> is a visual representation of the Thank You I extend to everyone that loves me, near and far. It’s a visual that shows just a fraction of beauty and unconditional love I receive from my siblings shown in the film and how much I miss it especially now given the state of the world. Bringing together people that I feel the world should see to sit in front of pink backdrop, asking for them to be their whole selves, unapologetically. 
Never would I have imagined we would be here, so far removed from this moment of soft vulnerability that was fortified with each other’s love. We were placed in spaces scattered and separated, wishing just to feel the warmth from one another. And it honestly has been taking a toll on me. Originally, this piece was to be something completely different. It was although, going to have the same kind of love as this piece but not the same intent or appreciation for the subjects. I guess that’s why I never shared it really, or for that matter “finished” it. What she wanted to be and what she needed to be were two completely different things.
And with that, I’m glad that I was able to finally share my message you.
So with that, I hope you enjoy it but more importantly, I hope you feel my love.
I just wanted to show everyone, all of you how much you mean to me.
  And what it’s like to miss <i>you.</i></p>
